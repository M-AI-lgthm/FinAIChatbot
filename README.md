3. **Semantic Retrieval**: Matches keywords with demo product catalog entries
4. **Context Augmentation**: Enhances LLM prompt with relevant demo product information
5. **Response Generation**: Google Gemini generates contextually-aware responses

### Example Demo Product Catalog

```python
products = {
    "demo-budget-pro": {
        "name": "Demo Budget Pro",
        "description": "Advanced personal and small business finance management",

*FinAI Chatbot: Bringing AI-powered sales assistance to businesses without existing chatbot infrastructure.*

### The Challenge
Problem: How do we create a dynamic, modern, and interactive platform to showcase our financial software products and provide immediate client support?

Solution: A web application built with Streamlit, featuring a powerful AI assistant.

### Our Technology Stack
This project combines powerful, flexible, and free tools to deliver a robust solution.

Streamlit: The core of our front-end. It allows us to build and deploy data-driven web applications quickly using pure Python.

Google Gemini 2.5 Flash: The brain of our chatbot. This large language model provides fast, high-quality responses for a seamless user experience.

Custom CSS: Used to style the application to match our brand, providing a clean and professional look.

Key Features of the Application
We've built a user-friendly and functional platform with three main components.

Modern Website Interface: A multi-page layout with a sleek design. The navigation bar and dark theme create a premium feel.

Reactive UI: The interface is built to respond dynamically. Clicking on a navigation button instantly changes the page content without a full refresh, providing a smooth user experience.

Integrated AI Chatbot: The chatbot is neatly integrated into the sidebar, offering instant assistance and product information. It‚Äôs always available but doesn‚Äôt clutter the main content area.

### The Chatbot in Action
The chatbot is more than a simple Q&A tool.

Contextual Understanding: It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate information. When a user asks about a product, the chatbot first checks our internal product catalog to find relevant data.

Personalized Responses: It uses the retrieved information to craft a helpful, context-aware answer.

Professional Persona: The chatbot's initial system prompt ensures it behaves like a professional and helpful financial sales assistant.
